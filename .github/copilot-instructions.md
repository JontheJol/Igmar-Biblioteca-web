## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript project using the following technologies:
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Material-UI (MUI)** for UI components and styling
- **Zustand** for state management
- **React Hook Form** with **Yup** for form validation
- **Material React Table** for data tables
- **React Router DOM** for routing
- **Vite** as the build tool

## Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Follow Material-UI design patterns and components
- Use Zustand for global state management
- Implement forms with React Hook Form and Yup validation
- Use Material React Table for data display
- Follow React Router DOM best practices for navigation
- Use ES6+ features and modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Ensure all components are properly typed with TypeScript interfaces
- Use consistent naming conventions (PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables)
